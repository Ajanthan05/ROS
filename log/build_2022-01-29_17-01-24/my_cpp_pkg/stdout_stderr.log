CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findecample_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ecample_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ecample_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    ecample_interfacesConfig.cmake
    ecample_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ecample_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ecample_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "ecample_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
